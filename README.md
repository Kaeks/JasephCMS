# CustomCMS
This CMS is still under development.
It uses a local database to store and read text from. Clone the repository and create a file called db_password.php, with the variables
`$servername`, `$username`, `$password` and `$dbname` and use them to store the corresponding values.
After you set up the database and a table called "feed" with an id, title and the content, everything should work.

### Enjoy!
